      <p class="card-text">Back in 1995, a developer at Netscape named Brendan Eich introduced JavaScript to the world. Despite Java and JavaScript both containing "Java" in their names, they're two distinct languages that have nothing to do with one another. The official name of JavaScript is ECMAScript which gets its name from the international organization that maintains it, <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/">ECMA (European Computer Manufacturer's Association</a>. JavaScript is a programming language used to make web pages interactive. Like HTML and CSS, you do not need to install anything to begin writing JavaScript or see it run on your users' computers. All modern browsers support JavaScript which means JavaScript that you write for your web pages will automatically run when your visitors load your web page in their browsers. In fact, JavaScript is the only scripting language that all browsers support so if you want a page to have dynamic content, learning JavaScript is a must.</p>
